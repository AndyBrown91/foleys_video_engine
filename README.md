Foleys Finest Audio Ltd. - Foleys Video Engine
==============================================

Daniel Walz - developer@foleysfinest.com - 2019

With the module foleys_video_engine we offer a simple way to implement reading,
writing, displaying and editing of videos using the audio framework JUCE (https://juce.com)

To read and write video files it uses FFmpeg (https://ffmpeg.org). Alternative backends
like AVFoundation (OSX) or DirectShow (Windows) might follow in the future, but no
promises.
